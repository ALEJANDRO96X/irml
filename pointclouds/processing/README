How to compile and execute the programs:

$ cmake .
$ make



Aligment:

./template_alignment ../../database/cloudsLabeled/object_templates.txt input.pcd

The object_templates.txt file contains the clouds the program is going to use as a template. They are referred from the processing/<program> folder since these programs are executed in their own folder.

input.pcd is a full point cloud. It can be in other folder as well.
