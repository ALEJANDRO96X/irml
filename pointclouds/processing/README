How to compile and execute the programs:

$ cmake .
$ make



- Aligment:

$ ./template_alignment ../../database/cloudsLabeled/object_templates.txt input.pcd

The object_templates.txt file contains the clouds the program is going to use as a template. They are referred from the processing/<program> folder since these programs are executed in their own folder.

input.pcd is a full point cloud. It can be in other folder as well.


- Init_segmentation:

$ ./segment input.pcd

It creates clusters for the main objects of a given point cloud. 


- SavingFramesOpenNiGrabber

$ ./pcd_write

This program saves one frame of a PrimeSense camera (Kinect, Xtion Pro...) every 30 frames.


- Segmentation:

$ ./segment <Folder>

It creates clusters for the main objects for all the given point clouds within a folder. 
<Folder> has to contain only other folders and pcd files.


- Segmentation_auto:

$ ./segment <Folder>

It creates clusters for the main objects for all the given point clouds within a folder. It also tries
to output the main cluster only (the one which is closer to the camera (lower Z coordinate).
<Folder> has to contain only other folders and pcd files.
